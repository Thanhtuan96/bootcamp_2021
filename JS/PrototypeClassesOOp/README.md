## What is prototypes

Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another. In this article, we explain how prototype chains work and look at how the prototype property can be used to add methods to existing constructors.

> Note: This article covers traditional JavaScript constructors and classes. In the next article, we talk about the modern way of doing things, which provides easier syntax to achieve the same things â€” see [ECMAScript 2015 classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance#ecmascript_2015_classes).

Reference-style Links
Reference-style links are a special kind of link that make URLs easier to display and read in Markdown. Reference-style links are constructed in two parts: the part you keep inline with your text and the part you store somewhere else in the file to keep the text easy to read.
